        <h2>NBKC Bank</h2>
        <p>
            'This is where I currently work. NBKC Bank is a tranditional bank that also offers excellent mortgage services. I have been
            working here for a year and a half. My first position was called Origination Support Specialist and I worked mainly as 
            a loan officer assistant. Last May, I transfered into the processing department and I have been working as a loan processor
            ever since. It is a pretty fun place to work. The hours are great and the work itself isn't too stressful. It is a good
            job to have while I work towards becoming a Software Engineer.'

            'This is my mom's real estate company that she has had for 10+ years. I worked here part time while also working the numerous
            teaching jobs listed below. There were pros and cons to working with my mom. Ultimately it didn't work out and I left and got the job
            at NBKC Bank.'

            <p>
                'I was a part time Assistant band director who primarly worked with the high school drumline. This was a really fun position as I was in charge of writing the music, 
                the warmups, and the technique packet. The hours were great - again, it was part time so I worked about 10-15 hours a week here while also working at 
                Michelle O'Connor Real Estate.'

            <p>
               'I worked this position at the same time while working at Liberty Public Schools. It was the same thing - I taught the kids how to kids play drums. However, I didn't 
               write any music or warmups or anything like that. Blue Springs has a reputation for being a very competitive marching band school so they already had those things
               taken care of. I worked this position in the evenings while working Liberty in the mornings.'

            <p>
               'This was my very last job in college. It was a pretty crappy job with the hours being all over the place for minimum wage. However, it was a college job and they let 
               me do my homework while I was working. I often tell people of the this job while refering to the billion dollar Powerball from a few years back. I had multiple professors
               come in and drop hundreds on lottery tickets promising me that if they won, they would give me a million bucks. Suffice to say, not a single one of them won.'

                <p>
                   'This was another college job that I worked. Without a doubt, this was the hardest job I have ever had or will ever have. I worked in the kitchen as a fry cook and
                   it was miserable. I ultimately worked here for about 7 months. I stayed that long because the pay was good and I got free food. If I was able to get free food while I 
                   was at work, it was a huge plus to me!'

               I am still friends with some of the people that I worked with here.'

            <p>
               'This was a random job to say the least. The only reason I got it was because my roommate at the time was working here and he helped me get the position. I worked in flooring
               and carpets and, funnily enough, I knew absolutely nothing about either of those things! Either way, this job was alright. It conflicted with my school schedule ultimately
               and I ended up leaving for the greener pastures of Chipotle.'
