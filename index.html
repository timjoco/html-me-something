        <h2>nbkc Bank</h2>
        <p>
            This is where I currently work and have been since May 2018. Nbkc Bank is a tranditional bank that also offers excellent mortgage services all over the United State. 
            My first position was called Origination Support Specialist (OSS) which is just a fancy title for a Loan Officer assistant. Last May, I transfered into the processing department and I have been working as a loan processor
            ever since. It is a pretty fun place to work. The hours are great, the pay is solid, and the work itself isn't too stressful. I think that it is the perfect place to work while I train to become a Software Engineer.

        <h2>Michelle O'Connor Real Estate</h2>
        <p>
            This is my mom's real estate company that she has had for 10+ years. While I technically only worked here part-time from January 2017 - April 2018, my entire life was spent in some shape or form at the office with my parents. I started learning how to do real estate work when I was 10 years old! 
            There were pros and cons to working with my mom, but ultimately it didn't work out and I left for my current position at nbkc Bank.

            <p>
                Before going full time at nbkc Bank, I was working in the high school band sector. Here, I was a part time Assistant Band Director who primarly worked with the high school drumline. This was a really fun position 
                as I was in charge of writing the music, the warmups, and the technique packet. The hours were great - again, it was part time so I worked about 10-15 hours a week here while also working at 
                Michelle O'Connor Real Estate and Blue Springs High School.

            <h2>Blue Springs Public Schools</h2>
            <p>
               As mentioned above, I was working at Blue Springs High School while simultaneously working at Liberty Public Schools and Michelle O'Connor Real Estate. Here my title was Snare Technician and I only work with the 
               high school drumline. Unlike my position at Liberty North, I didn't write any music or warmups. I was given the material and worked on it with the students. Blue Springs has a reputation for having a very competitive 
               marching band program so they already had those things taken care of. This was a great job and I am still close with the staff here. In fact, they were just shown on TV at the Macy's Day Parade in New York City!

            <h2>Daras Gas Station</h2>
            <p>
               This was my very last job in college. It was a pretty crappy job with the hours being all over the place for minimum wage. However, it was a college job and they let 
               me do my homework while I was working. The only worthwhile story from this position was during the billion dollar Powerball from a few years back. I had multiple professors
               come in and drop hundreds of dollars on lottery tickets promising me that if they won, they would give me a million bucks. Sadly though, not a single one of them won and I am still not a millionaire.

                <p>
                   This was another college job that I worked. Without a doubt, this was the hardest job I have ever had or will ever have. I worked in the kitchen as a fry cook and
                   it was miserable. I ultimately worked here for about 7 months. I stayed that long because the pay was good and I got free food. If I was able to get free food while I 
                   was at work, it was a huge plus to me!

            <h2>Chipotle</h2>
            <p>
               This was the job I held the longest while in college. I believe I was there was from Fall 2012 - Spring 2014. Honestly, I only stayed there that long because getting free Chipotle was (at the time) unbeatable. 
               This job was not bad and I am still friends with some of the people that I worked with. Also, yes, I can still fold burritos like a champ.

            <h2>Menards</h2>
            <p>
               This was a random job to say the least. The only reason I got it was because my roommate at the time was working here and he helped me get the position. I worked in flooring
               and carpets and, funnily enough, I knew absolutely nothing about either of those things! Either way, this job was alright. It conflicted with my school schedule ultimately
               and I ended up leaving for the greener pastures of Chipotle.

            <h2>Mr. Goodcents</h2>
            <p>
               This was my very first official job. As mentioned earlier, I had worked on and off for my parents company, but this was the first job I had away from them. I got it when I was a senior
               in high school. It was a great job (from what I can remember) and I mostly messed around as you can see from the picture of me planking (circa 2010). When I left for college in the summer of 2011,
               I got a position at the Mr. Goodcents in Manhattan, KS where I worked until the summer of 2012.
